## Lead Score Case Study Assignment

* The case study solutions and summary files are added here.

## Goals
* To Build a logistic regression model to assign a lead score between 0 and 100 to each of the leads which can be used by the company to target potential leads. A higher score would mean that the lead is hot, i.e. is most likely to convert whereas a lower score would mean that the lead is cold and will mostly not get converted.
* The model can able adjust to if the company's requirement changes in the future so you will need to handle these as well.
